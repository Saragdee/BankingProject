# Bank Account application
This Java project simulates basic banking operations.
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate and practice the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Java.

# Learning Objectives
- TBD
# Installation
To run this project, you need to have Java installed on your system. Follow these steps:

    1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
    2. Ensure Java JDK is installed on your machine.
    3. Compile the Java files in your preferred IDE or using the command line.

# Usage
The project consists of three main Java files:

`BankAccount.java` - Defines the BankAccount class with methods for various banking operations.

`BankAccountDemo.java` - Contains the main method and user interface for interacting with BankAccount objects.

`BankAccountTest.java` - Includes JUnit tests for validating the functionality of the BankAccount class.

# Running the Demo
Execute BankAccountDemo.java to start the program. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various banking operations.

## Example Operations
* `Deposit funds into an account.`
* `Withdraw funds from an account.`
* `Check the balance of an account.`
* `Transfer funds between accounts.`

# Testing
The `BankAccountTest.java` file contains [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) tests. These tests cover various scenarios including default and parameterized constructors, withdrawal, deposit, and transfer operations. Run this file to execute the tests and validate the functionality of the BankAccount class.
